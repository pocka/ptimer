# Why not "builder/"?

Because Elm compiler arrogantly forces files and direcotries to have PascalCase name.

Changing the `builder/` to `Builder/` alters resulting app's URL structure, hence the separated directory.
This is not the case if macOS/Windows used a sane filesystemâ€”case sensitive one.
